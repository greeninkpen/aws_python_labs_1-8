# Exercise 1: Introducing Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Programming languages are used to write instructions for computers. High-level means that Python commands are written with a combination of English words and special symbols. General-purpose means that Python is used by many people for different types of applications, such as desktop applications and websites.

Python has two major releases in use today, which are known as Python version 2.x and Python version 3.x. For Introduction to Programming, you will use Python version 3.6.x. Backward compatibility means that legacy code continues to work in new versions of the language. Generally, Python remains backward compatible within minor version releases. However, the major versions have syntax incompatibilities between them, such as between Python version 2.x and Python version 3.x.

The python.org website has installers and general documentation for Python.

Most systems will have one or more versions of Python installed, with Python version 2.7 as the default.

1. To confirm the default version of Python that is installed in your lab, in the open terminal tab, enter:

`python --version`

2. To check other available versions of Python, enter the following commands:

```bash
python --version
python2 --version
python3 --version
```

You might see results similar to the following examples:

```bash
~ $ python --version
Python 3.6.12
~ $ python 2 --version
Python 2.7.18
~ $ python3 --version
Python 3.6.12
```

# Exercise 2: Writing your first Python program

When someone learns how to program, it is traditional to start with the Hello, World program. This simple program verifies that you have installed the Python tools correctly.

3. From the navigation pane of the IDE, choose the file that you created in the previous Creating your Python exercise file section.

4. In the file, enter the following code:

`print("Hello, World")`

5. To save your file, choose File > Save.

6. Near the top of the IDE window, choose the Run (Play) button.

7. In the bottom pane of the IDE, confirm that the program prints the words Hello World.

Congratulations! You have written your first Python program.
